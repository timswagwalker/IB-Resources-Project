            <h5>Circular Flow of Income Model</h5>
            <img src="images/2-1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              In a closed economy with no government the households buy the nation’s output of goods and services and are owners of all the economy’s factors of production. They supply these factors of production to the firms and receive payment from
              them. By hiring these factors of production from the households, the firms make all of the nation’s output of goods and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              A country’s income is usually measured using GDP, however there are three main different methods for calculating GDP: output, income and expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Output method: measures the actual value of all goods and services produced in the country. </li>
              <li>Income method: measures the value of all incomes earned in the economy.</li>
              <li>Expenditure method: measures the value of all spending on goods and services. This includes household spending (consumption), spending by firms (investment), government spending, and spending on exports minus spending on imports.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/2-1-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>
              This shows the circular flow of income in an open economy with government and financial markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size of the circular flow depends on the size of the injections (STM) and leakages (GIX).
            </p>
            <p>
              When injections rise relative to withdrawals the economy will expand and when withdrawals rise relative to injections the economy will contract.

            <h4>Aggregate Demand</h4>
            <p>
              In microeconomics demand only represents the demand for one product or service in a particular market, whereas aggregate demand in macroeconomics is the total demand for goods and services in a period of time at a given price level.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2-2-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              <b>Components of AD</b>:<br>
              AD = G + I + C + (X - M)
            <ul>
              <li>C: Consumption</li>
              <li>I: Investment</li>
              <li>G: Government spending</li>
              <li>X: Exports</li>
              <li>M: Imports</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Negative slope</b>: AD has a negative slope because the relationship between price level and AD is inversely proportional, meaning that as the price level increases real AD decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The price level also represents inflation and real GDP also represents economic growth and employment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Movements along the AD curve</b>: these are a result of a change in price level.

            <img src="images/2-2-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              An increase in price level reduces the purchasing power of a given level of income and so individuals cannot afford to buy as many goods and services as their real income decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation is likely to result in higher interest rates which will reduce AD as it makes savings more attractive and borrowing less attractive for both firms and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in domestic prices makes a country’s exports less competitive on the world market and imports appear relatively cheap. This can reduce demand for exports.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Shift of the AD curve</b>: a change in any of the components of AD, not due to a change in price level will shift the AD curve.

              a: autonomous consumption – amount of money spent even if disposable income was zero in order to sustain life. This may have to come from savings or loans.
              <br>
              b: marginal propensity to consume – the proportion of an increase in income that is spent on domestic goods and services.
              <br>

            <p>
              An increase in injections (G, I or X) to the circular flow of income leads to a more than proportionate increase in national income.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in government spending on infrastructure, increases employment as a workforce is needed to fulfil the investment. Therefore, income levels, consumer confidence, consumer spending and, investment spending by firms would
              increase.
              <img src="images/2-2-6.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              The diagram shows how an increase in government spending on an infrastructure project will create new jobs, which provide workers with income. The workers will spend their income in local stores and as a result the income level of the
              store holders will increase. As a result of increased incomes the store owners may increase investment which may increase the number of jobs available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The multiplier effect will be higher the more of the increase in income that is spent i.e. the higher the value of MPC. In addition, the less money that is saved, spent on taxes and imports the bigger the final effect on the national
              income.
            </p>
            <p>
              Increase in AD from AD1 to AD2 represents the initial increase in spending. However, increase AD from AD2 to AD1 represents the multiplied increase in national income.

              <dd class="col-sm-9">The resources (land, labour, capital and enterprise) are not fully employed. It is possible to increase output without expecting an increase in costs and price level will remain constant.</dd>

            <p>
              The Keynesian economists believe that unemployment can exist in the long-run in an economy as the labour market does not always reach equilibrium resulting in unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A decrease in demand for goods and services results in a decrease in demand for labour, however, if the wage rate does not decrease to meet the new equilibrium, unemployment will exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wages are ‘sticky downwards’ because:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trade unions prevent wages falling</li>
              <li>A minimum wage exists</li>
              <li>Unemployment benefits prevent workers from accepting a continual cut to their wages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A shift in the LRAS is due to the same factors of production that shift the possibility production curve to the right, including improvements in efficiency, new technology, reductions in unemployment, and institutional change.

            <h4>Interest Rates</h4>
            <p><b>Monetary Policy</b>: the use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the level of economic activity. </p>
            <p>
              The central bank usually controls the money supply, such as the UK’s Bank of England.
              They are independent from the government, so they are less prone to political pressure from the government.
              The central bank sets the base/discount rate, which in turn influences the interest rate charged by financial institutions.
            </p>
            <p>For instance NatWest will have an interest rate from mortgages above the base rate, but if the base rate, which they are charged, increases then they will also increase the interest that they charge.
            </p>
            <p><b>Interest Rate</b>: the reward for saving and the cost of borrowing money, which is the price of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is charged on mortgages, loans to businesses and credit cards. It depends on the risk involved for the lender, as well as the base rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demand for money is due to the desire to buy goods and services and to hold it as assets.
              The total demand for money is inversely related to the rate of interest.
              The supply of money is not dependent on interest rates as it is determined by the central bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              The central bank determines the level of supply in attempt to change interest rates.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2-5-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <h4>Role of Monetary Policy</h4>
            <p>
              The central bank uses the following in order to adjust the money supply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The base rate of interest</li>
              <li>The reserve requirement</li>

                <p>The central bank is the lender of last resort, so loans to commercial banks when they cannot meet demands for consumers’ funds.</p>
                <p>If the base rate decreases, commercial banks lower their interest rates so loans are less expensive and with more loans the money supply increases and interest rates across the whole economy falls.</p>

              <dd class="col-sm-9">

                <p>A decrease in the reserve requirement allows commercial banks to lend more of the money they receive as deposits, which increases money supply and interest rates.</p>

                <p>The price of bonds depends on the demand and supply on the day – they are traded on the stock exchange.</p>

            <p><b>Interventionist policy</b>: this affects both AS and AD, as it involves government spending – a component of AD. Whilst it also increase productivity, total output and so AS.</p>

            <p><b>Investment in human capital</b>: investment in education and training will raise the levels of human capital and have a short-term impact on aggregate demand, but more importantly will increase LRAS. This is because a more skilled

                delivery. Education provides skills and productivity to the workforce, therefore increasing total output.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-3">Healthcare</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">in some countries the public health is poor, so there are many absentees from school or work. Therefore, the government may intervene to provide free or subsidised healthcare. </dd>

              and development programs.</dd>

            <p><b>Investment in infrastructure</b>: large scale building projects increase the output of the economy as it becomes cheaper and easier to produce and transport finished products. Also it will make the labour more geographically

            <h5>Trade creation and diversion</h5>

            <p>Trade creation is where trading blocs result in high cost domestic products being replaced by low cost and more efficient imports. This is believed to be beneficial as cheaper supplies from abroad allows for lower prices that benefit
              consumers.</p>

            <p>As a result of trade agreements, trade may be diverted from a more efficient exporter to a less efficient one, rather than creating new trade. This is usually due to the common external tariff that the countries in the trading bloc may
              agree to. Therefore, trading blocs may not always be best at promoting free trade. </p>

            <p><b>
                Terms of Trade = Index of exports prices / index of import prices x 100

            </dl>
            <h5>Consequences</h5>
            <p>If the price of exports rises, so the terms of trade improve, and these exports are price elastic, then there will be a significant decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign consumers. However, if the price for these exports falls
              then there will be a large increase in the quantity demanded by foreigners.
            </p>
            <p>
              If PED is inelastic and export prices rise, then there will be a much smaller decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign countries. If the prices fall, there will be a very small increase in demanded by foreign countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supply for primary commodities has general grown, due to technological progress in extraction techniques, whilst demand has tended to remain the same, as they are usually demand price inelastic goods. This has worsened the terms of
              trade of devloping countries that specialise in these goods because the prices have fallen due to the increased supply. Therefore, this may contribute to the world distribution of income becoming more unequal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, in the short term developing countries suffer because the supply of commodities tends to be price inelastic, due to the relience on good weather conditions, difficulty in storage and immobility of factors of production.
              Therefore, prices are often quite volatile which increases uncertainty in the developing countries' economies so foreign investment falls.
