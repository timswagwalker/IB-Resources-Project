            <h5>Circular Flow of Income Model</h5>
            <img src="images/2-1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              In a closed economy with no government the households buy the nation’s output of goods and services and are owners of all the economy’s factors of production. They supply these factors of production to the firms and receive payment from
              them. By hiring these factors of production from the households, the firms make all of the nation’s output of goods and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              A country’s income is usually measured using GDP, however there are three main different methods for calculating GDP: output, income and expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Output method: measures the actual value of all goods and services produced in the country. </li>
              <li>Income method: measures the value of all incomes earned in the economy.</li>
              <li>Expenditure method: measures the value of all spending on goods and services. This includes household spending (consumption), spending by firms (investment), government spending, and spending on exports minus spending on imports.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/2-1-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>
              This shows the circular flow of income in an open economy with government and financial markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size of the circular flow depends on the size of the injections (STM) and leakages (GIX).
            </p>
            <p>
              When injections rise relative to withdrawals the economy will expand and when withdrawals rise relative to injections the economy will contract.

            <h4>Aggregate Demand</h4>
            <p>
              In microeconomics demand only represents the demand for one product or service in a particular market, whereas aggregate demand in macroeconomics is the total demand for goods and services in a period of time at a given price level.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2-2-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              <b>Components of AD</b>:<br>
              AD = G + I + C + (X - M)
            <ul>
              <li>C: Consumption</li>
              <li>I: Investment</li>
              <li>G: Government spending</li>
              <li>X: Exports</li>
              <li>M: Imports</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Negative slope</b>: AD has a negative slope because the relationship between price level and AD is inversely proportional, meaning that as the price level increases real AD decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The price level also represents inflation and real GDP also represents economic growth and employment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Movements along the AD curve</b>: these are a result of a change in price level.

            <img src="images/2-2-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
              An increase in price level reduces the purchasing power of a given level of income and so individuals cannot afford to buy as many goods and services as their real income decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation is likely to result in higher interest rates which will reduce AD as it makes savings more attractive and borrowing less attractive for both firms and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in domestic prices makes a country’s exports less competitive on the world market and imports appear relatively cheap. This can reduce demand for exports.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Shift of the AD curve</b>: a change in any of the components of AD, not due to a change in price level will shift the AD curve.

              a: autonomous consumption – amount of money spent even if disposable income was zero in order to sustain life. This may have to come from savings or loans.
              <br>
              b: marginal propensity to consume – the proportion of an increase in income that is spent on domestic goods and services.
              <br>

            <p>
              An increase in injections (G, I or X) to the circular flow of income leads to a more than proportionate increase in national income.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in government spending on infrastructure, increases employment as a workforce is needed to fulfil the investment. Therefore, income levels, consumer confidence, consumer spending and, investment spending by firms would
              increase.
              <img src="images/2-2-6.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              The diagram shows how an increase in government spending on an infrastructure project will create new jobs, which provide workers with income. The workers will spend their income in local stores and as a result the income level of the
              store holders will increase. As a result of increased incomes the store owners may increase investment which may increase the number of jobs available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The multiplier effect will be higher the more of the increase in income that is spent i.e. the higher the value of MPC. In addition, the less money that is saved, spent on taxes and imports the bigger the final effect on the national
              income.
            </p>
            <p>
              Increase in AD from AD1 to AD2 represents the initial increase in spending. However, increase AD from AD2 to AD1 represents the multiplied increase in national income.

              <dd class="col-sm-9">The resources (land, labour, capital and enterprise) are not fully employed. It is possible to increase output without expecting an increase in costs and price level will remain constant.</dd>

            <p>
              The Keynesian economists believe that unemployment can exist in the long-run in an economy as the labour market does not always reach equilibrium resulting in unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A decrease in demand for goods and services results in a decrease in demand for labour, however, if the wage rate does not decrease to meet the new equilibrium, unemployment will exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wages are ‘sticky downwards’ because:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trade unions prevent wages falling</li>
              <li>A minimum wage exists</li>
              <li>Unemployment benefits prevent workers from accepting a continual cut to their wages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A shift in the LRAS is due to the same factors of production that shift the possibility production curve to the right, including improvements in efficiency, new technology, reductions in unemployment, and institutional change.

            <h4>Interest Rates</h4>
            <p><b>Monetary Policy</b>: the use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the level of economic activity. </p>
            <p>
              The central bank usually controls the money supply, such as the UK’s Bank of England.
              They are independent from the government, so they are less prone to political pressure from the government.
              The central bank sets the base/discount rate, which in turn influences the interest rate charged by financial institutions.
            </p>
            <p>For instance NatWest will have an interest rate from mortgages above the base rate, but if the base rate, which they are charged, increases then they will also increase the interest that they charge.
            </p>
            <p><b>Interest Rate</b>: the reward for saving and the cost of borrowing money, which is the price of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is charged on mortgages, loans to businesses and credit cards. It depends on the risk involved for the lender, as well as the base rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demand for money is due to the desire to buy goods and services and to hold it as assets.
              The total demand for money is inversely related to the rate of interest.
              The supply of money is not dependent on interest rates as it is determined by the central bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              The central bank determines the level of supply in attempt to change interest rates.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2-5-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <h4>Role of Monetary Policy</h4>
            <p>
              The central bank uses the following in order to adjust the money supply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The base rate of interest</li>
              <li>The reserve requirement</li>

                <p>The central bank is the lender of last resort, so loans to commercial banks when they cannot meet demands for consumers’ funds.</p>
                <p>If the base rate decreases, commercial banks lower their interest rates so loans are less expensive and with more loans the money supply increases and interest rates across the whole economy falls.</p>

              <dd class="col-sm-9">

                <p>A decrease in the reserve requirement allows commercial banks to lend more of the money they receive as deposits, which increases money supply and interest rates.</p>

                <p>The price of bonds depends on the demand and supply on the day – they are traded on the stock exchange.</p>

            <p><b>Interventionist policy</b>: this affects both AS and AD, as it involves government spending – a component of AD. Whilst it also increase productivity, total output and so AS.</p>

            <p><b>Investment in human capital</b>: investment in education and training will raise the levels of human capital and have a short-term impact on aggregate demand, but more importantly will increase LRAS. This is because a more skilled

                delivery. Education provides skills and productivity to the workforce, therefore increasing total output.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-3">Healthcare</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">in some countries the public health is poor, so there are many absentees from school or work. Therefore, the government may intervene to provide free or subsidised healthcare. </dd>

              and development programs.</dd>

            <p><b>Investment in infrastructure</b>: large scale building projects increase the output of the economy as it becomes cheaper and easier to produce and transport finished products. Also it will make the labour more geographically

            <h5>Trade creation and diversion</h5>

            <p>Trade creation is where trading blocs result in high cost domestic products being replaced by low cost and more efficient imports. This is believed to be beneficial as cheaper supplies from abroad allows for lower prices that benefit
              consumers.</p>

            <p>As a result of trade agreements, trade may be diverted from a more efficient exporter to a less efficient one, rather than creating new trade. This is usually due to the common external tariff that the countries in the trading bloc may
              agree to. Therefore, trading blocs may not always be best at promoting free trade. </p>

                Terms of Trade = Index of exports prices / index of import prices x 100

            </dl>
            <h5>Consequences</h5>
            <p>If the price of exports rises, so the terms of trade improve, and these exports are price elastic, then there will be a significant decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign consumers. However, if the price for these exports falls
              then there will be a large increase in the quantity demanded by foreigners.
            </p>
            <p>
              If PED is inelastic and export prices rise, then there will be a much smaller decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign countries. If the prices fall, there will be a very small increase in demanded by foreign countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supply for primary commodities has general grown, due to technological progress in extraction techniques, whilst demand has tended to remain the same, as they are usually demand price inelastic goods. This has worsened the terms of
              trade of devloping countries that specialise in these goods because the prices have fallen due to the increased supply. Therefore, this may contribute to the world distribution of income becoming more unequal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, in the short term developing countries suffer because the supply of commodities tends to be price inelastic, due to the relience on good weather conditions, difficulty in storage and immobility of factors of production.
              Therefore, prices are often quite volatile which increases uncertainty in the developing countries' economies so foreign investment falls.

<p><b>Economic growth</b>: an increase in the country's real output through time. </p>


<p><b>Economic development</b>: a qualitative measure of the country's standard of living. It is a more multidimensional concept than economic growth as it involves reducing widespread poverty, reducing income inequalities and increasing employment opportunities. </p>





<h4>Sources of economic growth in less developed countries</h4>
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Increases in human capital</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">new training and education schemes would likely improve the productivity of the workforce and therefore have a positive impact on economic growth. Also an increase in the birth rate, or a decrease in the mortality rate, that increases the labour force should lead to an increase in the national output. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Increases in physical capital</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">improvements and an increase in access to machinery would likely benefit firms by increasing their productivity and allowing them to expand, susbquently leading to economic growth. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">New technologies</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">technologies can often induce economic growth as they increase the efficiency of manufacturing and can reduce firms' costs of production. However, for developing countries, it is important that these technologies are not labour saving technologies as these replace the work done by individuals and lead to a increase in unemployment. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Institutional change</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">in order to encourage entrepreneurship and economic growth, it is exceedingly important that well defined property rights are established as these promote certainty and stability, which is necessary for investors to have confidence. In additon, in order to ensure that consumers have enough confidence to purchase goods and services, it is important that governments make reforms to increase transparency and reduce corruption. </dd>






<h4>The relationship between economic growth and development </h4>

<p>Some limited economic development is possible without economic growth. However, in the long term economic growth is usually necessary for economic development. This is because an increase in the quality of life tends to require an increase in real incomes. Also economic growth does not necessarily lead to economic development because the benefits of growth may be highly concentrated amongst a few individuals and therefore create a increase in income inequality. </p>





<h4>Common characteristics of economically less developed countries</h4>

<p>It is difficult to generalise about economically less developed counrties as their economies are shaped by their respective political and social history. However, they tend to share these common characteristics: </p>
<ul>
<li>Low levels of GDP per capita</li>
<li>High levels of poverty </li>
<li>Relatively large agricultural sector</li>
<li>Large urban informal sectors</li>
<li>High birth rates</li>
</ul>
<p>Some countries may be in a poverty trap (poverty cycle) where poor communities are unable to invest in physical, human and natural capital due to low or no savings; poverty is therefore transmitted from generation to generation, and there is a need for intervention to break out of the cycle.</p>






	<h4>Diversity amoung developing countries</h4>
<p>Developing countries range enormously in their resources, history, climate, political systems and degree of political stability. Take a look at this map showing the main exports of each country to see how developing countries compare to those that are more developed:</p>




	<h4>Country Profiles</h4>
<p> Afghanistan is situated in south east and central Asia. It has a population of about 33.4 million (UN, 2012) and its life expectancy for both men and women is 49 years (UN). The country has sufffered many conflicts and instability in recent times, which have contributed to damaged infrastructure and a fragile economy. </p>

<p> Bolivia is found in central South America, bordering Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. Its climate is variable, ranging from humid and tropical to cold and semiarid. Bolivia is a very resource rich country which predominantly relies on its natural gas exports as a source of growth. However, political instability, social tensions and a lack of foreign investment are attributed to its poor level of development. </p>

<p>Chad has a population of 11.8 million (UN, 2012) with a life expectancy of 49 year for men and 52 year for women (UN). The country is found in central Africa and its main languages are French and Arabic. Chad has a rich supply of uranium, gold and oil. However, the country is believed to have high levels of corruption, whilst it suffers from inadequate infrastructure and internal conflict. </p>




  <h4>Millennium Development Goals</h4>
<p>These are the world's targets for addressing poverty and improving the global standards of living. These goals are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty</li>
  <li>Achieve universal primary education</li>
  <li>Promote gender equality and empower women</li>
  <li>Reduce child mortality</li>
  <li>Improve maternal health</li>
  <li>Combate HIV/AIDs, malaria and other diseases</li>
  <li>Ensure environmental sustainability</li>
  <li>Global partnership for development</li>
  </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="anchor" id="item-4-2">4.2: Measuring Development</h3>



<h4>GDP Figures</h4>
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">GDP per capita</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the gross domestic product per person. This is the output per person within the borders of a country. For instance, the GDP per capita in France was $42560.40, whilst the GDP per capita in Guinea was $523.10 in 2013 (world bank).</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">GNI per capita</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">gross national income per person. This is the output per person produced by nationals of the country concerned, regardless of where they are.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="lead"><b>GDP = GNI + net income from abroad</b></p>
<p>For example, the GNI per capita in France was $43520, but $460 in Guinea in 2013 (world bank). France's GNI per capita is greater than its GDP per capita, which means that its net income from abroad is positive because output by nationals exceeds the output of those in France. In contrast, Guinea's net income from abroad, this would mean that non nationals contribute more to the country's real GDP than nationals living elsewhere do.</p>


<p><b>GDP per capita PPP</b>: gross domestic product at purchasing power parity. Purchasing power parity estimates the amount the exchange rate needs to be adjusted between countries in order for identical goods and services from different countries to have the same price.</p>

<p>The GDP per capita PPP in France is $14402.40, whereas Guinea's is $1253.10 in 2013 (world bank). This seems to narrow the gap between the two countries' GDP because the prices in Guinea are lower than those in France for the same goods and services.</p>




<h4>Health Indicators</h4>
<p>Although GDP and GNI figures can be very helpful in understanding an economy, they may fail to give the true impression on how developed a country is. This is because a very small percentage of the population may be earning the vast majority of the national income, therefore, the distribution of income may be far from equitable despite high levels of real output. If methods to redistribute income are not used, then the health of the average resident of the country may suffer. This could be due to a lack of government revenue from progressive taxation which may lead to a lack in government spending on health. Therefore, it is important to look at indicators other than GDP and GNI.</p>


The following are examples of health indicators:
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">Life expectancy at birth</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the number of years that a member of the population can be expected to live.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Maternal morality rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes).</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Infant mortality rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">compares the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The maternal and infant morality rates may be low, while the life expectancy may be high due to:</p>


<ul>
<li>Good public healthcare services accessible to all members of the population</li>
<li>A healthy environment with low pollution levels, adequate sanitation systems and safe drinking water</li>
<li>Healthy diets and avoidance of malnutrition</li>
<li>Well educated population</li>
<li>Low levels of inequality and poverty</li>
</ul>



<h5>United States</h5>
<p><b>Life expectancy at birth</b>: 78.6 years (2013)</p>
<p><b>Maternal morality rate</b>: 28</p>
<p><b>Infant mortality rate</b>: 5.9</p>

<h5>Brunei</h5>
<p><b>Life expectancy at birth</b>: 71 years (2013)</p>
<p><b>Maternal morality rate</b>: 27</p>
<p><b>Infant mortality rate</b>: 8.4</p>

<p><small>All of these statistics can be found on the world bank's website and are from 2013.</small></p>

<p>It may seem surprising that such a dominant country like the United States, does not have particularly impressive health statistics compared to a relatively small developing country like Brunei. However, this may be due to inequalities in income and education amongst the population, leading to concentrate areas of poverty. In addition, this could arguably be due to a lack of good medical coverage accessible for all income groups.</p>

<p>In contrast, Brunei's life expectancy may seem relatively high due to policies like the government funded AIDs awareness campaign and the fact that individuals requiring medical assistance unavailable in the country are sent overseas for it at the government's expense.</p>



<h4>Education Indicators</h4>
<p>Like health, education is very important in considering the standards of living within a country. A more educated population also tends to lead to a more productive workforce in the long run, from which economic growth should follow. However, some countries do not follow this pattern because they have strong economic growth but their governments fail to invest in state provided, or subsidized, education which can lead to greater inequality. However, in some cases, developing countries with low GDP levels have focused on sustaining a good education system as their primary focus.</p>



The following are examples of education indicators...
<dl class="row">
	<dt class="col-sm-3">Adult literacy rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Primary school enrollment</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the total enrollment in primary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population of official primary education age. This can exceed 100% due to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students because of early or late school entrance and grade repetition.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Secondary school enrollment</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the total enrollment in secondary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population of official secondary education age. This can exceed 100% due to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students because of early or late school entrance and grade repetition.</dd>
</dl>


<h5>Norway</h5>

<p><b>Literacy rate</b>: 100% (2010)</p>
<p><b>Primary school enrollment</b>: 99.4% (2012)</p>
<p><b>Secondary school enrollment</b>: 111% (2012)</p>


<h5>Russia</h5>

<p><b>Literacy rate</b>: 100% (2010)</p>
<p><b>Primary school enrollment</b>: 100.6% (2012)</p>
<p><b>Secondary school enrollment</b>: 95% (2012)</p>

<p><small>All of these statistics can be found on the world bank's website and are from.</small></p>

<p>Norway is known worldwide for having very high standards of living, however, Russia, despite being a developing economy, also has very impressive education statistics. This is believed to be due to the communist history of Russia, whose leaders placed great importance on investing in its education system.</p>




<h4>Composite Indicators</h4>
<p>Composite indicators include more than one measure and so are considered to be better indicators of economic development. The main one that tends to be used is the Human Development Index.</p>
<p>The HDI measures development by combining indicators of life expectancy, education attainment, and income. The education component contains two indicators: expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling. The income component is measured by GNI per capita (PPP$).</p>



HDI Value
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">High Human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">0.800 and above</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Medium human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">0.500 - 0.799</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Low human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">less than 0.500</dd>
</dl><p>
Some lower income countries may have a high HDI value because of their high life expectancy and education attainment which may be due to their well run and well provided public services.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="anchor" id="item-4-3">4.3: Domestic Factors</h3>
            <h4>Education and health</h4>

<p>Education is extremely important in improving the living standards of a country as it not only benefits the individuals receiving the education, but there is also a wider benefit to society. This is because a more educated, highly skilled workforce tends to have higher levels of productivity and therefore greater national output. This extra income earned from the increase in output can then be reinvested, either privately or by the government through redistributive policies, in order to further improve the country's development. In addition, a more educated population improves communication and can lead to social reform.</p>

<p>The Cuban government spent 12.8% of GDP on education in 2010, whereas the Central African Republic only spent 1.2% in 2010 and 2011. The adult literacy rate for Cuba was 100% in 2012, but 37% for the Central African Republic in 2010. Cuba's HDI value was 0.851 in 2013, in contrast to the Central African Republic's value which was 0.341. It is therefore not surprising that Cuba's population is more productive and it's GDP per capita was $6,051.20 in 2011, whereas the Central African Republic's was $494.90 in the same year.</p>

<p>Like education, the health of the population is an important component in achieving both development and growth. Increased access to public funded medical care is key to increasing the health of the population, as without this the disparity between rich and poor may widen both in terms of income and in terms of their quality of life. A healthier population increases the labour force as more child reach adulthood and have a longer life expectancy. Also each individuals' productivity can improve because they contract fewer illness and therefore need to take less time off from work. </p>

<p>Cuba's health expenditure per capita was $603, whereas the Central African Republic's was just $13 in 2013. Cuba's life expectancy at birth has remained at 79 years from 2010 to 2013, whereas the Central African Republic's has increased from just 49 years to 50. </p>



<h4>Appropriate technologies</h4>



<p>Labour intensive technologies: use more labour in relation to capital. These increase local employment and the use local skills and materials. Incomes and poverty alleviation should also increase.</p>

<p><b>Capital intensive technologies</b>: use more capital in relation to labour. In developing countries with large supplies of labour they displace workers and increase unemployment, reduce incomes and increase poverty. They require skill levels that may be costly and difficult to acquire, as well as relying on expensive imports. However, these are an important component for increase economics growth in more developed countries where there are higher levels of employment anyway. </p>

<p>Technology is important in aiding development, however, it must be suitable for the specific economic, geographical, ecological and climatic conditions. Developing countries tend to require technologies that make use of the abundance of workers, but are relatively easy to maintain and operate. Therefore, often developing countries adopt labour intensive technologies that are slightly more primitive than those adopted by developed countries. For instance, in a developing country it may be preferable to start using ploughs pulled by animals rather than tractors as tractors may lead to an increase in unemployment and have imported into the country which adds to their expense. Also if tractor were used, then workers would also need to be educated in the more complex maintenance. This illustrates why development is usually a gradual process rather than a sudden change. </p>
<p>Technology has also been instrumental in improving the daily lives of individuals in developing countries. Inexpensive tablets and laptops are now being manufactured for children around the world to have greater access to education and reduce the digital divide between the rich and poor. The spread of mobile phones has increased the efficiency of businesses the world over as it has helped to decrease the costs associated with poor communication and given firms in developing countries to opportunity to access international markets more easily. In addition, companies are creating innovative ways to help developing countries make use of their natural resources to use as renewable energy, such as cheap solar panels that now provide electricity to villages where it was previously absent. Other technologies, such as water filters and toilets, are playing an important role in improving the sanitation within developing countries which helps to reduce the spread of diseases. </p>

<p>Here are some specific examples of technology improving the lives of people in developing countries: </p>

<p>After mobile phones were made available to fishermen in Kerala in India, they were able to call several markets and agree on selling prices before landing their fish. Within a few weeks the fluctuation in fish prices subsided, increasing the fishermen's profit by 9% and reducing consumer prices by 4%.</p>

<p>To do business with Shoprite of South Africa when it opened supermarkets in Zambia, local farmers' cooperatives used new marketing and production techniques to improve the quality of their products and services. Shoprite now buys 90% to 95% of its fresh produce from Zambian farmers. In one cooperative, farmers' cash income increased from between $2 and $3 a month to between $50 and $70, and local access to health care and education services improved. </p>




<h4>Micro-credit</h4>
<p><b>Micro-credit</b>: small loans are lent to businesses in developing countries, therefore, enabling them to become independent and self employed.</p>

<p>This can allow families and communities to escape poverty as they have a means of earning their own incomes without taking on large financial risks. This does not only benefit the direct recipients, but other locals as well since individuals can afford to spend more money in their local communities. Therefore, micro-credit can help to encourage self-reliance amongst the communities in which it is available so the benefits should continue for future generations.</p>

<p>Micro-credit is often given to women as they are often responsible for bringing up the next generation and therefore can have a profound influence on the future developed of the country. This therefore grants them the opportunity to raise the standard of living of their families and improve their own physical and social wellbeing.</p>

<p>Micro-credit can also prevent vulnerable individuals from being financially exploited as their is less need to rely on 'loan sharks', who are illegal moneylenders that often charge very high rates of interest. In addition, micro-credit is available to those who are usually unable to take out loans from conventional financial institutions. This is because micro-credit can be offered to individuals without the need for credit ratings or collaterals, which is a security pledged for the repayment of a loan.</p>

<p>However, there are some limitations of micro-credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments may feel less urgency to pursue other poverty reducing policies</li>

<li>A lack of regulation may lead to 'loan sharks' claiming that they are legitimate micro-credit providers</li>

<li>Micro-credit alone is unlikely to be successful at reducing poverty. This is because it may impact the lives of individuals, but the benefits will not be felt equally across the country. Such regional differences may occur because micro-credit providers are more likely to be found in cities as rural areas are more difficult to access.</li>

<li>The government must be reliable in creating an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and investment. Corruption and poor management would likely threaten the success of micro-credit.</li>

</ul>


<h4>The empowerment of women </h4>
<p>Across the world many societies still feature elements of gender inequality. However, women are an essential component of promoting both economic development and economic growth. Gender inequality has a detrimental effect on the quality and quantity of labour and consequentially leads to limited productivity. Allowing women to work and be active members in society directly increases the labour force, therefore, enabling the countries output to increase. In addition, women in developing countries are often responsible for rearing children which means that the education that such children receive is likely to depend on the female members of their community. It therefore seems clear that it is important to educate women in order to improve the quality of the future labour force.</p>
<p>Policies to empower women may focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreasing the female mortality rate</li>

<li>Increasing the access and quality of education for girls and women</li>

<li>Improving the provision of healthcare for women</li>

<li>Improving access to economic opportunities for women. This may include increasing women's participation in the labour force and improving access to micro-credit.</li>

<li>Increasing respect for women both in society and in domestic situations. For example, the government could ensure that women have the vote and are able to express their views.</li>

<li>Limiting gender inequalities from being replicated in future generations. This may be done by using education to reduce misunderstandings about the differences between males and females.</li>

</ul>




<h4>Income distribution</h4>
<p>Income inequality is a significant factor that contributes to poverty and holds back countries from developing. As a result of the unequal distribution of factors of production, inequalities in income begin to occur. For instance, when people settle in an area, individuals acquire land of different quality and quantity. Therefore, when they farm such land, the results and incomes vary. It would seem that in any society some degree of inequality is therefore inevitable and perhaps necessary in order to provide people with incentives to work.</p>

<p>However, small differences in income, can perpetuate to become larger as time goes on. This can occur because the richer in society are more able to afford the opportunities needed to retain the high levels of income. For instance, in corrupt societies bribes may be paid in return for favors, whilst more generally the rich can afford healthcare and education for their children which maintain their high standard of living. In the absence of progressive taxation and transfer payments, the poorer sector of society may fail to benefit from the successes of the higher income earners. This is particularly true if regions become segregated into the rich and poor, as the high incomes remain concentrated in the pockets of great wealth. This demonstrates how the rich may get richer, whilst the poor slip further into poverty.</p>

<p>Large income gaps between the rich and poor have social implications as well, which effect the standards of living. This is because such divisions create misunderstanding and prejudice. In turn, dissatisfaction amongst the poorest may increase and social frictions may be exacerbated.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is important to have an effective progressive taxation system in order to deal with inequalities in the income distribution. This is because in a progressive taxation system, high income earners pay a greater proportion in tax compared to low income earners. The revenue from such a system can then be used to fund transfer payment, including unemployment benefits, and public services, such as education and healthcare. These then allow the lower income earners to have access to more opportunities which can improve their social and economic mobility.</p>
