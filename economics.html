			<h4>Markets</h4>

			<p>These are some key words and definitions which must be learnt as in the exams you must define the terms that you use to demonstrate you true understanding.</p>
			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Scarcity</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the condition of having unlimited wants/desires and limited resources (or distribution /dissemination of them)</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Market</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">a place where buyers and sellers meet and agree on a price of goods or services.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Opportunity cost</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone</dd>
			</dl>



			<h4>Demand </h4>

			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Demand</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the willingness and ability of the consumer to consume a good or service in a given amount of time.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">The law of demand</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">as the price of a product falls, the quantity demanded of the product will usually increase, ceteris paribus.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The market demand gives the total quantity demanded by all consumers. The individual demand is the demand of one individual or firm.</p>

			<p>The demand curve represents the relationship between the price and the quantity demanded of a product.</p>

			<p>The change in the price of a good causes a movement along the demand curve. For instance, as price falls from P to P1 the demand moves down the demand curve, which increase the quantity demanded from Q to Q1.</p>

			Picute 1-1-1 comes here.




			<h5>The non-price determinants of demand</h5>

			A change in the non-price determinants shift the demand curve because the quantity demanded at the price has changed.
			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Substitutes</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">Goods that can be used in place of one another as they satisfy the same needs. If the price of a substitute rises, demand for the good will increase. If the price of coffee falls, many people will shift from drinking tea to drinking coffee and the demand curve for tea shifts in to the left

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Complements</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">Goods which tend to be used jointly. If the price of a complement rises, demand will decrease. If the price of petrol rises people are motivated to use their car less, and the demand for cars shifts to the left.

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Population</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if the population grows/changes composition (old/young) there are more consumers and demand will shift out to the right</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Tastes and preferences</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">more people may want the product or service (a product becomes 'fashionable') and demand shifts out</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Real income</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">when income rises, more people can afford to buy cars and the demand curve for cars shifts to the right for normal goods and a decrease in demand for inferior goods. (Don't worry too much about this definition, it will become clearer once you have studied income elasticity, just remember real income affects demand)</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Advertising</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the more effective the advertising the greater the demand, unless the government uses negative advertising for things such as the dangers to health from cigarette smoking</dd>
			</dl>
			<p class="lead">Remember SCRIPTA: <b>substitutes, complements, real income, population,  tastes, advertising</b></p>






			<h5>Linear demand functions (equations), demand schedules and graphs (HL)</h5>

			Picture 1-1-2

			<p class="lead"><b>Demand function</b>: Qd = a - bP</p>
			<p>'A' causes a shift in the demand curve because a= the quantity demanded when the price is 0, so, if a decreases the curve will shift to the left (non-price factors)</p>
			<p>The slope will depend on '-b' (negative because the relation QD=P is inverse) that is the responsiveness of the consumer to a change in price. It can depend on the number of substitutes. So if it becomes less responsive to substitutes the steepness of the curve will increase</p>





			<h4>Supply</h4>
			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Supply</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the total amount of goods and services that producers are willing and able to purchase at a given</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">The law of supply</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">as the price of a product rises, the quantity supplied of the product will usually increase, ceteris paribus.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The market supply gives the total quantity supplied by all individual producers.</p>

			<p>The supply curve represents the relationship between the price and the quantity supplied of a product, ceteris paribus.</p>



			Picture 1-1-3 here

			<p>The change in the price of a good causes a movement along the supply curve. For instance, as price increases from P to P1 the supply moves up the supply curve, which increases the quantity supplies from Q to Q1.</p>




			<h5>Non-price determinants of supply</h5>

			Picture 1-1-4 here.

			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Factors of production</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">changes in costs of factors of production, including land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship (human capital or intellectual capital).
			If these costs increase, then supply shifts to the left.
			If the government suddenly increased the minimum wage then this could greatly increase the costs of labour to a shoe making factory, this would cause a shift in supply to the left.

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Subsidy</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">effectively reduces the firm's costs of production, so supply shifts outwards.
			A change in the non-price determinants shift the supply curve because the quantity supplied at the price has changed</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Indirect tax</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">effectively increases the firm's variable costs, so supply shifts inwards.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Expectations</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">If demand for a product is likely to rise, for example due to a successful advertisement campaign or celebrity endorsements, supply increases.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Price of relating product</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if producer could produce another product with higher profitability, due to limited resources, the quantity supplied of the original product would decrease.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Number of firms in the market</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">more firms producing shifts supply to the right as more is being supplied at each price</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Transportation and infrastructure</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if these improve then supply shifts outwards because the firm's average costs are lowered.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">State of technology</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">If technology improves then supply shifts to the left. As the firm can become more efficient with the same amount of costs so increase output.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p class="lead">Remember PERSISTT: <b>production, expectations, related, size, infrastructure, subsidy, tax and technology</b></p>





			<h5>Linear supply functions, equations and graphs (HL)</h5>


			<p class="lead"><b>Supply function</b>: Qs = c + dP</p>

			Picture 1-1-5 here

			<p>'C' causes a shift in the supply curve because c = the quantity supplied when the price is 0, so, if c decreases the curve will shift to the left (non-price factors)</p>

			<p>The slope will depend on d (positive because the relation QD=P is)   that is the responsiveness of the producer to a change in price. It can depend on the number of factors of production.</p>






			<h4>Market equilibrium and changes in equilibrium</h4>



			<p><b>Market equilibrium</b>: where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded</p>


			Picture 1-1-6, 1-1-7 and 1-1-8 here

			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Excess supply</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">more is being supplied than demanded at P1, in order to eliminate the surplus, producer must lower the price</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Excess demand</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">more is being demanded than supplied at P2, in order to eliminate the surplus, producer must raise the price</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>When there is a change in determinants of demand/supply other than the price of the product, it would lead to a shift of a curve.</p>

			<p>When demand shifts to D1, Qe is the quantity supplied, but Q2 is the quantity demanded, there is excess demand.</p>

			<p>The price will rise until P1, where the new equilibrium quantity, is both demanded and supplied.</p>







			<h5>Calculating and illustrating equilibrium using linear equations (HL)</h5>


			<p>The graph shows that the equilibrium price and quantity are Pe, which is between $6 and $7, and Qe, which is between 10 and 20 units. However, to get more exact values calculations can be used.</p>

			Picture 1-1-9 and 1-1-10 here

			<p>This shows how to calculate the equilibrium price and quantity. At the equilibrium Qs = Qd.</p>

			Picture 1-1-11 here

			<p>This graph now shows that at new higher price P1, there is an excess supply of Q1 to Q2.</p>

			Picture 1-1-12  and 1-1-13 here.






			<h4>The role of the price mechanism</h4>


			Picture 1-1-14 and 1-1-15 here

			<p>The price mechanism moves the market into equilibrium, so that the scarce resources are reallocated.</p>
			<dl class="row">
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Opportunity cost</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">is the next best alternative forgone. When a choice is made, there is an opportunity cost.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Rationing function</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">Prices serve to ration scarce resources when demand in a market outstrips supply.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Signalling function</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">prices rise and fall to reflect surpluses and scarcities, which shows where resources are required.</dd>
			<dt class="col-sm-3">Transmission of preferences</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">through their choices consumers send information to producers about the changing nature of needs and wants.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If prices of bikes are rising because of high demand from consumers, this is a signal to suppliers to expand production to meet the higher demand.</p>

			<p>If there is excess supply in the market the price mechanism will help to eliminate a surplus of a good by allowing the market price to fall.</p>

			<p>An increase in market supply causes a fall in the relative prices of laptops and prompts an expansion along the market demand curve.</p>

			<p>When there is a shortage, the price is bid up, leaving only those with the willingness and ability to pay to purchase the product. The market price acts a rationing device to equate demand with supply.</p>

			<p>Higher prices act as an incentive to raise output because the supplier stands to make a better profit.</p>

			<p>When demand is weaker in a recession then supply contracts as producers cut back on output.</p>






			<h4>Market efficiency</h4>

			<dl class="row">

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Consumer surplus</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the extra satisfaction a consumer gains from paying a price less than they were prepared to pay.</dd>

			<dt class="col-sm-3">Producer surplus</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the excess of actual earnings that a producer makes from a given quantity of output, over and above the amount the producer would be prepared to accept for that output.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>When a market is allocatively efficient, the social (community) surplus is maximised, this is made up of the consumer and producer surplus. This means that the marginal social benefit = the marginal social cost.</p>

			<p>Allocative efficiency happens when competitive market is in equilibrium, where resources are allocated in the most efficient way from society's point of view.</p>

            <h3 class="anchor" id="item-1-2">1.2: Elasticities</h3>
            <h4>Price elasticity of demand</h4>

<p><b>Price elasticity of demand (PED)</b>: the measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price, along a demand curve. Mathematically the value is negative, as the demand curve slopes downwards, but we treat it as a positive value</p>

<p class="lead"><b>PED = (&Delta;% Qd) / (&Delta;%P)</b></p>

PICTURE 1-2-1 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price elastic demand: PED&gt;1</b></p>
<p>This means that a small percentage change in price causes a large percentage change in quantity demanded.
This is usual for luxury goods with many substitutes, such as ferraris, gucci bags and superyachts.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-2 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price inelastic demand: 0&lt;PED&lt;1</b></p>
<p>This means that a large percentage change in price causes a small percentage change in quantity demanded.
This is usual for necessity goods with few substitutes, like bread, milk and electricity</p>

PICTURE 1-2-3 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price unitary elastic demand: PED=1</b></p>
<p>This means that a percentage change in price causes a proportionate percentage change in quantity demanded.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-4 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Perfectly price elastic demand: PED=&infin;</b></p>
<p>This means that an infinitesimally small percentage change in price causes infinitely large percentage change in quantity demanded.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-5 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Perfectly price inelastic demand: PED=0</b></p>
<p>This means that an infinitely large percentage change in price causes infinitesimally small percentage change in quantity demanded.</p>
<p>In order to remember this graph just remember the demand curve is a vertical line like an 'I' so it must be 'I'nelastic.</p>






<h5>Determinants of PED</h5>

<dl class="row">


<dt class="col-sm-3">Income spent</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the higher the proportion of income spent of purchasing a product, the higher the product's PED.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Degree of necessity and how widely defined</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if a product has a high degree of necessity and is well defined, then it will have a low PED, as it is more inelastic
For instance water will have a high PED.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Number and closeness of substitutes</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the great quantity of close substitutes a product has the higher the PED value, meaning it is more elastic.
For instance toothbrushes have high elasticities, as there are lots of brands selling similar toothbrushes.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Time period considered</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">when price of a product changes it takes time for consumers to adapt (lag time) and it takes time to adjust purchasing habits. This means that the more time it takes the higher the PED. The product will be inelastic in the short term, but elastic in the long term.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To remember these determinants of PED, just think TINS.</p>







<h5>Calculate PED</h5>

<p>The slope of a straight-line demand curve, one with a constant slope, has constantly changing elasticity. It includes all five elasticity alternatives--perfectly elastic, relatively elastic, unit elastic, relatively inelastic, and perfectly inelastic. No two points on a straight-line demand curve have the same elasticity because the slope and elasticity are different concepts. Slope measures the steepness or flatness of a line in terms of the measurement units for price and quantity. Elasticity measures the relative response of quantity to changes in price.</p>


PICTURE 1-2-6 HERE

<p>Calculate the PED, when there is a price increase from P1 to P2.
<br>
PED = (1/3*100) / (3/3*100)<br>
PED = 0.33 = inelastic
</p>




<h5>Applications of PED</h5>

<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">Significance to firms</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if PED is inelastic then the firm can increase its revenue by increasing the price per unit, because demand will remain high.
If PED is elastic then the firm can decrease its price to increase revenue because demand will increase by a more than proportional quantity.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Significance to governments</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if the government uses indirect taxes to tax a good with inelastic PED, then they will gain higher government revenues than a good with elastic PED.
This is part of the reason why cigarettes, petrol and alcohol are so highly taxed.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Manufactured goods</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">tend to have a high PED because they are usually not necessity good but have many close substitutes.
For instance cotton socks, seeded bread, Demerara sugar.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Primary commodities</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">tend to have a low PED because they are usually necessity goods with no close substitutes.
For instance wheat, cow leather, raw cane sugar, coal, cotton plant.</dd>


</dl>



<h4>Cross Price Elasticity</h4>




<p><b>Cross price elasticity (XED)</b>: the measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good.</p>

<p class="lead"><b>XED = (&Delta;% Qd of A) / (&Delta;%P of B)</b></p>

<p>There is a movement along the demand curve for one good causing a shift in the demand for another good.</p>


<p>If XED is zero then the two goods are unrelated to each other.<br>
For example the XED will be about zero for makeup and soup, fluffy toys and glasses, coffee and a sofa.</p>


<p>If XED is negative then the two goods are compliments of each other. The higher the value the closer the compliments.<br>
For example the XED will be a high negative value for games console and x-box, pencils and pencil case, car and petrol.</p>


<p>If XED is positive then the two goods are substitutes of each other. The higher the value the closer the substitutes.<br>
For example the XED will be a high positive value for iPhones and blackberries, CDs and online music purchasing, crunchy nut cereal and cheerios cereal.</p>

<p>The absolute XED value therefore depends on the closeness of the relationship between the goods.<br>
For instance petrol and cars are likely to have a higher negative XED value than toast and marmite, even though they are also compliments</p>







<h5>Applications of XED</h5>


<p>High negative XED value: firms may wish to have this because it means that the goods are more likely to complement each other, so they will often be purchased together. Therefore, the firm has greater a greater market to sell to and a higher demand is sustained.</p>

<p>Low positive XED value: firms may wish to have this because it means that the goods are less likely to be substituted for each other, so there is less competition. Therefore, the firm can keep the price higher.</p>






<h4>Income Elasticity of Demand</h4>

<p><b>Income elasticity of demand (YED)</b>: the measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in income.</p>

<p class="lead"><b>YED = (&Delta;% Qd) / (&Delta;% income)</b></p>

<p>A change in income shifts the demand curve.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-7 HERE
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Normal good</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">demand increases for a normal good as income increases, so they have a positive YED.
For instance televisions and mobile phones</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Inferior good</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">demand decreases for an inferior good as income increases, so they have a negative YED.
For instance own brand food, second hand cars</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Luxury goods</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">income is elastic as 1&lt;YED, so the percentage change in demand is very significant as income rises. This is because once needs have been fulfilled, people purchase their wants in a great number.
For instance jewellery, gadgets, expensive holiday homes, caviar, champagne.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Necessity good</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">income is inelastic as 0&lt;YED&lt;1, so the percentage change in demand is very small as income rises
For instance food, water, clothing, shelter.</dd>


</dl>


<h5>Applications of YED</h5>
<ul>
<li>If there is a high YED for manufactured goods, then consumers will continue to buy it as long as they can afford it.</li>

<li>During an economic crisis producers are unlikely to be making a lot of revenue on manufactured goods as they are income elastic.</li>


<li>If there is relatively low YED, the producer can raise or lower the prices, despite the state of the economy, consumers will continue to buy the good because it is income inelastic.</li>


<li>If there is an even higher YED for services, the demand will decrease because it is merely a luxury good and not a necessity, meaning it is income elastic.</li>

</ul>






<h4>Price elasticity of supply</h4>

<p><b>Price elasticity of supply (PES)</b>: the measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a good to a change in its price, along a supply curve</p>

<p class="lead"><b>PES = (&Delta;% Qs) / (&Delta;%P)</b></p>

<p>The value will always be positive because the supply curve slops upwards.<p>

PICTURE 1-2-8 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price elastic supply: PES>1</b></p>
<p>This means that a small percentage change in price causes a large percentage change in quantity supplied.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-9 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price inelastic supply: 0&lt;PES&lt;1</b></p>
<p>This means that a large percentage change in price causes a small percentage change in quantity supplied.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-10 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Price unitary elastic supply: PES=1</b></p>
<p>This means that a percentage change in price causes a proportionate percentage change in quantity supplied.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-11 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Perfectly price inelastic supply: PES=0</b></p>
<p>This means that an infinitely large percentage change in price causes infinitesimally small percentage change in quantity supplied.</p>

PICTURE 1-2-12 HERE

<p class="lead"><b>Perfectly price elastic supply: PES=&infin;</b></p>
<p>This means that an infinitesimally small percentage change in price causes infinitely large percentage change in quantity supplied.</p>







<h5>Determinants of of PES</h5>

<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">Ability to store stock</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">if the producers are able to store more stock, then the supply is more elastic because they are able to respond to price increases with swift supply increases.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Mobility of factors of production</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the more mobile the factors of production are the more elastic supply is. This is because it is easier to move to another production, with lower average costs, when price rises.
For instance a printing press can easily be switched from printing magazines to printing cards.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Unused capacity</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the more unused capacity the more elastic supply is because not all resources are being used so output can easily be increased by using these without incurring great costs.
For instance the supply of goods and services is most elastic during a recession, when there is plenty of spare labour and capital resources.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Time period considered</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the longer the time period considered the more elastic the supply is as there is greater time to increase the factors of production, like capital.</dd>

<h5>Applications of PES</h5>

<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">Primary commodities</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">tend to have a low PES because there cannot be a sudden change in how much is produced.

<h4>Indirect Taxes</h4>

<p><b>Aim of imposing indirect taxes</b>: the government does such spending in order to raise tax revenues and to internalise externalities, to achieve the optimum level of output.</p>


<p><b>A specific tax</b>: a fixed amount of tax that is imposed on a product, which shifts the supply curve vertically upwards by the amount of tax. </p>
PICTURE 1-3-1

<p><b>An ad valorem tax</b>: the tax is a percentage of the selling price and so the supply curve will shift by an increasing amount as the price of the product rises.</p>

PICTURE 1-3-2

<p>When either specific taxes or valorem taxes are imposed, the market will shrink in size (decrease in quantity), thus possibly lower the level of employment in the market, since firms might employ fewer people. (Curve shifts up because it increases costs of production.)</p>

<h4>Tax Incidence and Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply <span class="badge badge-success">Higher Level</span></h4>


PICTURE 1-3-5

<p>If a good with inelastic demand is taxed, the tax burden can be easily passed on to the consumer (PED is less than PES)</p>

<p>This means the tax burden on the consumer (C) is greater than the tax burden on the producer (P).</p>

<p>As shown in this diagram, the producer would like to raise the price to P4, to pass all the tax burden onto consumers. However, this would cause excess supply, so prise falls to a new equilibrium at P2.</p>

PICTURE 1-3-6

<p>If a good with elastic demand is taxed, the tax burden on the consumer (C) is less than the tax burden on the producer (P). (PED is more+ than PES)</p>

<p>In this second scenario, the producer would like to increase the price to P4, to pass all the tax burden on to consumers. However, this would cause excess supply, so price falls to a new equilibrium of P2. This is where enough consumers would continue to buy but not all of the tax burden is taken by the producer. </p>

Producer tax burden = 1000 * 0.50 = $500<br>

Consumer tax burden = 1000 * 1 = $1000
</p>


<h4>Subsidies</h4>

<p><b>Subsidy</b>: an amount of money paid by the government to a firm per unit of output. This causes the supply curve to shift to the right by the amount of subsidy.</p>



PICTURE 1-3-8



<p><b>Aims of subsidies</b>: To ensure consumers can afford necessary goods: the price of the product will be lowered so that more consumers are able to buy.
For instance in Malaysia millions is being spent in order to subsidise food and fuel to keep prices low. Like sugar which is an essential ingredient in Asian cooking. (July 2012).</p>

<p><b>Protectionism</b>: subsidies are used to help domestic firms become more competitive in the international markets therefore increasing export revenue. This is in order to address a balance of payment deficit. For example the USA subsidises their steel industry, in order to protect it against countries, such as Brazil, where steel can be produced more cheaply.</p>

<p><b>To ensure consumers buy merit goods</b>: merit goods are goods or services which are provided for the benefit of society.  They are usually under-consumed and under-supplied, this is a result of information failure about the private and external benefits the good can have. Therefore, the government subsidises them in order to make more consumers willing and able to consume. Examples of merit goods are pensions, healthcare, insurance and education. In Columbia for instance health insurance is subsidised.</p>

<p><b>Guarantee the supply of products</b>: the government may believe that some industries need to be supported by lowering their average costs of production. This may be in order to ensure them for future times such as war. Also this could be to provide employment. For instance the power supply in India is most states is subsidised as the government believes it is necessary for the economy.</p>



PICTURE 1-3-9 and PICTURE 1-3-10

<p>When subsidies are provided, the market will expand in size (increase in quantity), thus possibly raise the level of employment in the market, since firms might employ more people. (Curve shifts down because costs of production decrease).</p>


<p>
<b>Producer</b>: revenue increases from P1Q1 to P3Q2.
<b>Consumer</b>: price per unit decreases from P1 to P2


<b>Cost to government</b>: P3P2Q2</p>

<p>The total cost of the subsidy exceeds the benefit of the consumers and producers so there is a loss of welfare, a deadweight loss. Subsidies may undermine foreign firms. For instance developed countries may have subsidised farming making their products cheaper than underdeveloped countries. Firms may become inefficient as they are not competing against foreign firms. There is an opportunity cost as the government spending on the subsidy could have been put to other projects.</p>

<br>
Original community surplus = 3600 + 2400 =$6000
<br>

New community surplus = 3500 + 2100 = $4600
</p>










<h4>Maximum prices (Price Ceilings)</h4>

<p><b>Maximum prices</b>: the government sets a price below the equilibrium price to prevent producers from raising the price above it.</p>



<p>Prices are set in order to protect consumers from the high prices of merit and/or necessary goods because these would be underprovided in a free market.</p>

<p>For instance, during food shortages the government may impose a maximum price on the cost of wheat in order to ensure that food prices a low enough for all income levels to afford. Also in London maximum prices have been used in order to keep the rent lower than the market equilibrium in attempt to ensure affordable accommodation is available for those on low incomes.</p>

PICTURE 1-3-12 and PICTURE 1-3-13 and PICTURE 1-3-14

<p>When a maximum price at Pmax is put emplace by the government, below the equilibrium price of Pe, there is an excess demand of Qs to Qd. This is because at the new price the quantity demanded is Qd, but the quantity supplied is Qs. S1 is the supply of rented housing at the maximum price in the long run. It gets more elastic as people will stop letting houses as they cannot justify the opportunity cost.</p>

<p>The excess demand from maximum price may result in shortages. This could lead to the emergence of a black market or parallel underground market, where the products are sold at a higher price than the maximum price but less than the equilibrium price.</p>

<p>Non-price rationing systems may emmerge and involve long queues or reservations if working on a first come first serve basis in order to determine which consumers to serve.</p>


<p><b>Welfare</b>: there is a deadweight loss of BCE. This is because consumer surplus has changed from AEPe to ACBPmax whilst producer surplus has decreased from 0EPe to 0BPmax, as a result of the maximum price imposed. It is therefore not allocative efficient as community surplus is not maximised.</p>

<p>In this diagram, the government has shifted the supply curve from S to S1 by subsidizing, direct provision or using stores to reach the equilibrium at Pmax Qd.</p>

<p>However, these methods can be very expensive and so there is an opportunity cost as the government may have to reduce its expenditure on other industries, like health or education.</p>

<h4>Minimum prices (Price Floors)</h4>

PICTURE 1-3-16 and PICTURE 1-3-17 and PICTURE 1-3-18  and PICTURE 1-3-19

<p><b>Minimum price</b>: price set above the equilibrium price by the government, which prevents producers from reducing their prices to below it.</p>

<p>Prices are set in order to protect the supply of products that the government believes are important, such as agricultural products. This may be because their products are subject to large price fluctuations or there is a lot of foreign trade. Minimum prices also protect workers as they act as a minimum wage, which ensures that workers earn enough to lead a reasonable existence. Other reasons include for strategic importance and to prevent rural urban migration.</p>

<p>When a minimum price at Pmin is put emplace by the government, above the equilibrium price of Pe, there is an excess supply of Qs to Qd. This is because at the new price the quantity demanded is Qd, but the quantity supplied is Qs.</p>

<p>Minimum prices usually result in a supply surplus. The government may therefore deal with it by increasing demand through advertising, restricting the amount of imports, selling the product cheaply abroad (undermines foreign farmers) or buying the product up themselves and storing or burning it, which can be very expensive. For instance, some EU countries do this and it is referred to as wine lakes and butter mountains.</p>

<p>Other methods to deal with the surplus affect the supply of a product. These are usually quotas which limit how much a producer is legally allowed to produce. The EU calls these method a set aside policy.</p>


<p><b>Welfare</b>: there is a welfare deadweight loss of BCE. This is because consumer surplus has decreased from AEPe to ACPmin whilst producer surplus has changed from 0EPe to 0ECPmin, as a result of the minimum price imposed. It is therefore not allocative efficient as community surplus is not maximised.</p>

			<p><b>Market failure</b>: the failure for the market to successfully achieve allocative efficiency, because there is an over or under provision of a good. So community surplus is not maximized and the socially desirable level of output is not achieved.</p>



			<p><b>Marginal private cost (MPC)</b>: private supply curve that is based on the firm's costs of production</p>

			<p><b>Marginal social cost (MSC)</b>: MPC+/-external cost</p>

			<p><b>Marginal private benefit (MPB)</b>: private demand curve that is based on the utility or benefits to consumers</p>

			<p><b>Marginal social benefit (MSB)</b>: MPB+/-external benefit to third party</p>




			<h4>Negative externalities</h4>

			PICTURE 1-4-1 AND PICTURE 1-4-2

			<p><b>Externalities</b>: occur when the production or consumption of a good or service has an effect upon a third party. MSC does not equal MPC.</p>

			<p><b>Negative externalities of production</b>: occur when the production of a good or service creates external costs that are damaging to third parties (MSC>MPC).</p>

			<p><b>Examples</b>: carbon emissions from factories, factory waste disposal, noise pollution, fossil fuels.</p>


			<p>The diagram shows that MSC is less than MPC. So the firm is only paying the private costs a Q. This means that the socially efficient output where MSB=MSC at quantity Q* is not being achieved. The triangle shows the welfare loss, as community surplus has decreased.</p>


			<p><b>Negative externalities of consumption</b>: occur when the consumption of a good or service creates the external costs that is damaging to third parties (MSB &lt; MPB &#41;</p>
			<p><b>Examples</b>: smoking, alcohol, cars, loud music, coal fires.</p>


			<p>In this diagram we assume that MSC = MPC. However, MPB is greater than MSB, meaning that the product is not being consumed at the socially desirable level of MSB = MSC and so there is a welfare loss, of the triangle.</p>




			<p><b>Demerit goods</b>: goods that the government think are bad for both people who consume them and society as a whole and therefore should be consumed to a lesser degree or not at all. These are goods whose consumption creates external costs.</p>
			<p><b>Examples</b>: cigarettes, alcohol, hard drugs, child pornography</p>


			<h5>Policies to reduce negative externalities</h5>

			PICTURE 1-4-3 AND PICTURE 1-4-4

			<p>
			Indirect taxes may be imposed by the government to reduce the negative externality of production or consumption, such as a tax on carbon or cigarettes. This means that the firm�s costs of production effectively increase and MPC, so the firm will reduce its output, as it becomes less profitable. Therefore, the externality is internalised.
			</p>

			<p>Indirect taxes do not necessarily stop an activity completely as it is dependent on the individual consumers' and producers' reactions to the tax.</p>

			<p>The effectiveness of the tax depends on the ability of the government to determine the correct level.</p>
			<p>If the tax is too high: too little consumed and produced; if tax is too low: too much is still consumed and produced. Therefore, the deadweight loss is reduced but not eliminated. This is shown in the diagrams on the previous page.</p>

			<p>It also depends on the elasticity of demand. If PED is inelastic the increase in price leads to a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity demanded. So the socially desirable level of output may still not be achieved.</p>

			<p>An increase in tax may also cause consumers and producers to use the black market instead, therefore, the externality will remain.</p>

			<p>An increase in government revenue could allow the government to further invest into reducing the negative externality, such as improving zero carbon alternatives.</p>


			<p><b>Command and control techniques</b>: government legislation to ban activities with negative externalities.
			For example, the Chinese government could ban firms from dumping factory waste in rivers.</p>

			<p><b>Evaluation</b>: this can completely stop an activity, however, it must be monitored effectively with regular checks that may be expensive. Also there must be high penalties to deter firms or consumers from breaking the law, this must be greater than the cost the firm would have from reducing the externality.
			For instance in order to decrease the number of cars used in a town, the local government may increase the price of car parking tickets which would have to be well monitored to ensure everyone was paying. If they were not then there would be high fines.</p>

			<p><b>Tradable pollution permits (cap and trade)</b>: the government sets a limit on the amount of pollution. Each firm is allocated or buys permits allowing it a certain amount of pollution. Permits can be sold is not used.</p>

			<p><b>Evaluation</b>: it is in the firms� interest to reduce pollution as they can receive an income from selling permits and with more pollution they will incur more costs. If the government gradually reduces the permits available then pollution will gradually decease. However, there is difficulty in setting the cap and the effectiveness depends on the permits� price. If permits were given away for free, then there would be little incentive to reduce pollution.</p>

			<p><b>Advertising</b>: this along with education can also reduce the negative externality, as it raises the awareness of the effects on others.</p>






			<h4>Positive externalities</h4>

			PICTURE PICTURE 1-4-5 AND PICTURE 1-4-6

			<p><b>Positive externalities of production</b>: occur when the production of a good or service creates external benefits for third parties (MPC>MSC).
			Even though these types of externality may seem to be a good thing, especially due to the name, they are still a market failure as the goods and sevices with positive externalities are underporvided or underconsumed compared to the socially optimal level.</p>

			<p><b>Examples</b>: industrial training in firms, research into new technologies.</p>



			<p>The diagram shows that MSC is less than MPC. So the firm is producing at a level, Q, which is less than the socially desirable level of Q*. Therefore, there is a welfare loss.</p>


			<p><b>Positive externalities of consumption</b>: occur when the consumption of a good or service creates external benefits for third parties (MSB>MPB).
			<p><b>Examples</b>: immunisations, education, healthcare.</p>


			<p>The diagram shows that MSB is greater than MPB. So the firm is producing at a level, Q, which is less than the socially desirable level of Q*. Therefore, there is a welfare loss.</p>


			<p><b>Merit goods</b>: goods that the government think are good for both people who consume them and society as a whole and therefore should be consumed to a greater degree. These are goods whose consumption creates external benefits.</p>
			<p><b>Examples</b>: healthcare, education, museums.</p>



			<h5>Policies to reduce positive externalities</h5>

			PICTURE 1-4-7 AND PICTURE 1-4-8

			<p>Subsidies may be introduced by the government to reduce the private costs associated with positive externalities and therefore shift the MPC curve to the right, so that the quantity of output will be closer to the socially desirable level of output. Subsidies are very costly for the government so many developing countries cannot afford them. Also there is always an opportunity cost as the money could be spent differently on other policies and the government may need to either go into debt in order to fund the subsidies or increase taxes. Subsidies can encourage inefficiency as producers rely on them rather than more efficiently allocating resources through the free market. The effectiveness of the subsiy depends on the ability of the government to determine the correct socially desirable level of output. As shown in these diagrams: </p>

			<p><b>Positive advertising campaign</b>: these explain the benefits of consuming the good or service to consumers, so the MPB curve will shift to the right, closer to the MSB curve.</p>

			<p><b>Evaluation</b>: advertising can have very high costs and opportunity costs. Also the benefits may take many years to materialise and so its short term effects are limited.</p>

			<p>The direct provision of a good also helps to decrease the private costs associated with consumption, such as the NHS healthcare system and state school education.</p>

			<p>Legislation of a good also helps to decrease the private costs associated with consumption, such as secondary school attendance being mandatory.</p>






			<h4>Lack of public goods</h4>



			<p><b>Public goods</b>: goods and services not provided by a free market.
			They are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. There is therefore a 'free rider' problem which means that it is difficult to prevent people who do not pay for the good from consuming it.  Also public goods do not run out after being consumed.</p>
			<p><b>Examples of public goods</b>: lighthouses, streetlights, public statues, education, healthcare, sports centres.</p>

			<p><b>Private goods</b>: an item that yields positive benefits to people that is excludable (owners can exercise private property rights, preventing others from using the good or consuming its benefits) and rivalrous (consumption by one necessarily prevents that of another)</p>

			<p><b>Under consumption of public goods causing a market failure</b>: the "free rider" principle says that you cannot charge an individual a price for the provision of a non-excludable good because somebody else would gain the benefit from consumption without paying anything. If left to its own devices, merit goods (a private good that society considers under consumed, often with positive externalities) will be underprovided. These are goods and services which have a positive effect on society like education, healthcare and sports centers</p>

			<p><b>Disadvantages from the government providing public goods</b>: the costs are borne by taxpayers who do not necessarily use the good, there is crowding out of the private sector and there is an opportunity cost.</p>

			<p><b>Advantages from the government providing public goods</b>: there is greater equality as everyone has access and greater efficiency as the government can use economies of scale and provide gods collectively. Also it overcomes the free rider problem.</p>




			<h4>Common access resources and the threat to sustainability</h4>
			<p>When there is a lack of a pricing mechanism for common access resources, the goods are susceptible to overexploitation as a result of the producers and consumers actions. Therefore, this is unlikely to be sustainable.</p>
			<p><b>Examples of common access resources</b>: common land, fishing lakes, forests, irrigation system and pastures.</p>

			<p>The 'tragedy of the commons' exists because it is very difficult and expensive to exclude people from using these areas.</p>

			<p><b>Sustainability</b>: exists when consumption needs of present generation are met without reducing ability to meet needs of future generations</p>

			<p>Pursuit of economic growth results in environmental externality problems such as over-exploitation of land, soil erosion, land degradation, and deforestation. For developing countries these problems compound poverty and low standards of living.</p>

			<p>The government may respond to threats of sustainability by imposing taxes, legislation, cap and trade schemes and using extra revenue from taxes for clean technology.</p>

			<p>However, government responses to sustainability are limited by the global nature of the problems and the lack of ownership of common access resources, so effective responses require international cooperation.</p>






			<h4>Asymmetric information <span class="badge badge-success">Higher Level</span></h4>

			<p><b>Asymmetric information</b>: when buyers and sellers do not have equal access to information in a transaction.</p>

			<p><b>Sellers have more information</b>: in the second hand car market and at the doctors/dentists there is unequal information. This is also the case for financial advisers. It could result in a market failure as consumers are less willing to consume due to a lack of trust, so even sellers who are truthful lose out on sales.</p>

			<p><b>Buyers have more information</b>: when purchasing car or health insurance the buyer may know information about themselves which, had the seller known, would have adjusted the price. Also in the labour market, regulation prevents employers from gaining knowledge about the prospective employee that may unfairly impact their opinion, such as age.</p>

			<p><b>Government responses</b>: the government may use legislation, like building regulations or legal contracts confirming no information has been withheld.</p>

			<p>Also the government could provide information. For instance food is labelled with nutrition guidance, whilst the income of consumers is usually validated against the tax office. Licences can also be used. For instance food stores must have licences stating what food can be sold.</p>

            <p>
              In a closed economy with no government the households buy the nation’s output of goods and services and are owners of all the economy’s factors of production. They supply these factors of production to the firms and receive payment from
              them. By hiring these factors of production from the households, the firms make all of the nation’s output of goods and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              A country’s income is usually measured using GDP, however there are three main different methods for calculating GDP: output, income and expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Output method: measures the actual value of all goods and services produced in the country. </li>
              <li>Income method: measures the value of all incomes earned in the economy.</li>
              <li>Expenditure method: measures the value of all spending on goods and services. This includes household spending (consumption), spending by firms (investment), government spending, and spending on exports minus spending on imports.

            <p>
              The size of the circular flow depends on the size of the injections (STM) and leakages (GIX).

            <p>
              In microeconomics demand only represents the demand for one product or service in a particular market, whereas aggregate demand in macroeconomics is the total demand for goods and services in a period of time at a given price level.

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Negative slope</b>: AD has a negative slope because the relationship between price level and AD is inversely proportional, meaning that as the price level increases real AD decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The price level also represents inflation and real GDP also represents economic growth and employment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Movements along the AD curve</b>: these are a result of a change in price level.

            <p>
              An increase in price level reduces the purchasing power of a given level of income and so individuals cannot afford to buy as many goods and services as their real income decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation is likely to result in higher interest rates which will reduce AD as it makes savings more attractive and borrowing less attractive for both firms and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in domestic prices makes a country’s exports less competitive on the world market and imports appear relatively cheap. This can reduce demand for exports.

            </h5>
            <p>
              An increase in injections (G, I or X) to the circular flow of income leads to a more than proportionate increase in national income.
            </p>
            <p>
              An increase in government spending on infrastructure, increases employment as a workforce is needed to fulfil the investment. Therefore, income levels, consumer confidence, consumer spending and, investment spending by firms would
              increase.
              <img src="images/2-2-6.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              The diagram shows how an increase in government spending on an infrastructure project will create new jobs, which provide workers with income. The workers will spend their income in local stores and as a result the income level of the
              store holders will increase. As a result of increased incomes the store owners may increase investment which may increase the number of jobs available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The multiplier effect will be higher the more of the increase in income that is spent i.e. the higher the value of MPC. In addition, the less money that is saved, spent on taxes and imports the bigger the final effect on the national
              income.
            </p>
            <p>
              Increase in AD from AD1 to AD2 represents the initial increase in spending. However, increase AD from AD2 to AD1 represents the multiplied increase in national income.
            </p>
            <p>
              The multiplier can be calculated by two different formulae.

            <p>
              The Keynesian economists believe that unemployment can exist in the long-run in an economy as the labour market does not always reach equilibrium resulting in unemployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A decrease in demand for goods and services results in a decrease in demand for labour, however, if the wage rate does not decrease to meet the new equilibrium, unemployment will exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wages are ‘sticky downwards’ because:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trade unions prevent wages falling</li>
              <li>A minimum wage exists</li>
              <li>Unemployment benefits prevent workers from accepting a continual cut to their wages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A shift in the LRAS is due to the same factors of production that shift the possibility production curve to the right, including improvements in efficiency, new technology, reductions in unemployment, and institutional change.

            <h4>Interest Rates</h4>
            <p><b>Monetary Policy</b>: the use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the level of economic activity. </p>
            <p>
              The central bank usually controls the money supply, such as the UK’s Bank of England.
              They are independent from the government, so they are less prone to political pressure from the government.
              The central bank sets the base/discount rate, which in turn influences the interest rate charged by financial institutions.
            </p>
            <p>For instance NatWest will have an interest rate from mortgages above the base rate, but if the base rate, which they are charged, increases then they will also increase the interest that they charge.
            </p>
            <p><b>Interest Rate</b>: the reward for saving and the cost of borrowing money, which is the price of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is charged on mortgages, loans to businesses and credit cards. It depends on the risk involved for the lender, as well as the base rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demand for money is due to the desire to buy goods and services and to hold it as assets.
              The total demand for money is inversely related to the rate of interest.
              The supply of money is not dependent on interest rates as it is determined by the central bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              The central bank determines the level of supply in attempt to change interest rates.

            <h4>Role of Monetary Policy</h4>
            <p>
              The central bank uses the following in order to adjust the money supply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The base rate of interest</li>
              <li>The reserve requirement</li>
              <li>The purchase of government bonds</li>
            </ul>

                <p>The central bank is the lender of last resort, so loans to commercial banks when they cannot meet demands for consumers’ funds.</p>
                <p>If the base rate decreases, commercial banks lower their interest rates so loans are less expensive and with more loans the money supply increases and interest rates across the whole economy falls.</p>

              <dd class="col-sm-9">
                <p>the central bank controls the amount of money that the commercial banks have to keep on deposit to meet the needs of their customers, in the UK it is 20% of the customer’s savings.</p>
                <p>A decrease in the reserve requirement allows commercial banks to lend more of the money they receive as deposits, which increases money supply and interest rates.</p>
              </dd>

              <dd class="col-sm-9">
                <p>a bond is an IOU issued by the government in return and so represents a loan to the government. It guarantees the holder the repayment of the money, on a given date, with fixed annual interest.</p>
                <p>The price of bonds depends on the demand and supply on the day – they are traded on the stock exchange.</p>
                <p>The government may issue a large number of these to the commercial banks to reduce the money supply and interest rates.</p>

            <p>

            <h4>Contractionary Monetary Policy</h4>

            <h5>Preferential Trade Agreements</h5>
            <p>These give preferential access to certain products from certain countries by reducing or eliminating tariffs, or by other agreements relating to trade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically they involve agreements to improve trade liberalisation between countries. There are two types:
            </p>
            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-3">Bilateral agreements</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">these are between two countries.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-3">Multilateral agreements</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">these are between more than two countries.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              Bilateral agreements tend to be easier to implement, however, multilateral agreements tend to be beneficial to more people.
            </p>
            <h5>Trading Blocs</h5>
            <p><b>Advantages</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free trade within the bloc</li>
              <li>Easier to access other markets</li>
              <li>Firms can expand to make use of economies of scale</li>
              <li>Growth in exports will create jobs</li>
              <li>Firms inside the bloc are protected from cheaper goods being offered outside of it</li>
              <li>Trade creation </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce beneficial effects of free trade, like specialisation and exploitation of comparative advantage</li>
              <li>Inefficiencies – fail to make use of more efficient firms outside of the bloc</li>
              <li>Trade diversion </li>
              <li>The common external tariff may lead others to retaliate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Trade creation and diversion</h5>

            <p>Trade creation is where trading blocs result in high cost domestic products being replaced by low cost and more efficient imports. This is believed to be beneficial as cheaper supplies from abroad allows for lower prices that benefit
              consumers.</p>

            <p>As a result of trade agreements, trade may be diverted from a more efficient exporter to a less efficient one, rather than creating new trade. This is usually due to the common external tariff that the countries in the trading bloc may
              agree to. Therefore, trading blocs may not always be best at promoting free trade. </p>

              The terms of trade is the ratio of the avergae price of exports over the avergae price of imports expressed as index numbers times by 100:
            </p>
            <p><b>
                Terms of Trade = Index of exports prices / index of import prices x 100

            </dl>
            <h5>Consequences</h5>
            <p>If the price of exports rises, so the terms of trade improve, and these exports are price elastic, then there will be a significant decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign consumers. However, if the price for these exports falls
              then there will be a large increase in the quantity demanded by foreigners.
            </p>
            <p>
              If PED is inelastic and export prices rise, then there will be a much smaller decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign countries. If the prices fall, there will be a very small increase in demanded by foreign countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supply for primary commodities has general grown, due to technological progress in extraction techniques, whilst demand has tended to remain the same, as they are usually demand price inelastic goods. This has worsened the terms of
              trade of devloping countries that specialise in these goods because the prices have fallen due to the increased supply. Therefore, this may contribute to the world distribution of income becoming more unequal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, in the short term developing countries suffer because the supply of commodities tends to be price inelastic, due to the relience on good weather conditions, difficulty in storage and immobility of factors of production.
              Therefore, prices are often quite volatile which increases uncertainty in the developing countries' economies so foreign investment falls.

<p><b>Economic growth</b>: an increase in the country's real output through time. </p>


<p><b>Economic development</b>: a qualitative measure of the country's standard of living. It is a more multidimensional concept than economic growth as it involves reducing widespread poverty, reducing income inequalities and increasing employment opportunities. </p>





<h4>Sources of economic growth in less developed countries</h4>
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Increases in human capital</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">new training and education schemes would likely improve the productivity of the workforce and therefore have a positive impact on economic growth. Also an increase in the birth rate, or a decrease in the mortality rate, that increases the labour force should lead to an increase in the national output. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Increases in physical capital</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">improvements and an increase in access to machinery would likely benefit firms by increasing their productivity and allowing them to expand, susbquently leading to economic growth. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">New technologies</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">technologies can often induce economic growth as they increase the efficiency of manufacturing and can reduce firms' costs of production. However, for developing countries, it is important that these technologies are not labour saving technologies as these replace the work done by individuals and lead to a increase in unemployment. </dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Institutional change</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">in order to encourage entrepreneurship and economic growth, it is exceedingly important that well defined property rights are established as these promote certainty and stability, which is necessary for investors to have confidence. In additon, in order to ensure that consumers have enough confidence to purchase goods and services, it is important that governments make reforms to increase transparency and reduce corruption. </dd>






<h4>The relationship between economic growth and development </h4>

<p>Some limited economic development is possible without economic growth. However, in the long term economic growth is usually necessary for economic development. This is because an increase in the quality of life tends to require an increase in real incomes. Also economic growth does not necessarily lead to economic development because the benefits of growth may be highly concentrated amongst a few individuals and therefore create a increase in income inequality. </p>





<h4>Common characteristics of economically less developed countries</h4>

<p>It is difficult to generalise about economically less developed counrties as their economies are shaped by their respective political and social history. However, they tend to share these common characteristics: </p>
<ul>
<li>Low levels of GDP per capita</li>
<li>High levels of poverty </li>
<li>Relatively large agricultural sector</li>
<li>Large urban informal sectors</li>
<li>High birth rates</li>
</ul>
<p>Some countries may be in a poverty trap (poverty cycle) where poor communities are unable to invest in physical, human and natural capital due to low or no savings; poverty is therefore transmitted from generation to generation, and there is a need for intervention to break out of the cycle.</p>






	<h4>Diversity amoung developing countries</h4>
<p>Developing countries range enormously in their resources, history, climate, political systems and degree of political stability. Take a look at this map showing the main exports of each country to see how developing countries compare to those that are more developed:</p>




	<h4>Country Profiles</h4>
<p> Afghanistan is situated in south east and central Asia. It has a population of about 33.4 million (UN, 2012) and its life expectancy for both men and women is 49 years (UN). The country has sufffered many conflicts and instability in recent times, which have contributed to damaged infrastructure and a fragile economy. </p>

<p> Bolivia is found in central South America, bordering Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. Its climate is variable, ranging from humid and tropical to cold and semiarid. Bolivia is a very resource rich country which predominantly relies on its natural gas exports as a source of growth. However, political instability, social tensions and a lack of foreign investment are attributed to its poor level of development. </p>

<p>Chad has a population of 11.8 million (UN, 2012) with a life expectancy of 49 year for men and 52 year for women (UN). The country is found in central Africa and its main languages are French and Arabic. Chad has a rich supply of uranium, gold and oil. However, the country is believed to have high levels of corruption, whilst it suffers from inadequate infrastructure and internal conflict. </p>




  <h4>Millennium Development Goals</h4>
<p>These are the world's targets for addressing poverty and improving the global standards of living. These goals are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty</li>
  <li>Achieve universal primary education</li>
  <li>Promote gender equality and empower women</li>
  <li>Reduce child mortality</li>
  <li>Improve maternal health</li>
  <li>Combate HIV/AIDs, malaria and other diseases</li>
  <li>Ensure environmental sustainability</li>
  <li>Global partnership for development</li>
  </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="anchor" id="item-4-2">4.2: Measuring Development</h3>



<h4>GDP Figures</h4>
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">GDP per capita</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the gross domestic product per person. This is the output per person within the borders of a country. For instance, the GDP per capita in France was $42560.40, whilst the GDP per capita in Guinea was $523.10 in 2013 (world bank).</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">GNI per capita</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">gross national income per person. This is the output per person produced by nationals of the country concerned, regardless of where they are.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="lead"><b>GDP = GNI + net income from abroad</b></p>
<p>For example, the GNI per capita in France was $43520, but $460 in Guinea in 2013 (world bank). France's GNI per capita is greater than its GDP per capita, which means that its net income from abroad is positive because output by nationals exceeds the output of those in France. In contrast, Guinea's net income from abroad, this would mean that non nationals contribute more to the country's real GDP than nationals living elsewhere do.</p>


<p><b>GDP per capita PPP</b>: gross domestic product at purchasing power parity. Purchasing power parity estimates the amount the exchange rate needs to be adjusted between countries in order for identical goods and services from different countries to have the same price.</p>

<p>The GDP per capita PPP in France is $14402.40, whereas Guinea's is $1253.10 in 2013 (world bank). This seems to narrow the gap between the two countries' GDP because the prices in Guinea are lower than those in France for the same goods and services.</p>




<h4>Health Indicators</h4>
<p>Although GDP and GNI figures can be very helpful in understanding an economy, they may fail to give the true impression on how developed a country is. This is because a very small percentage of the population may be earning the vast majority of the national income, therefore, the distribution of income may be far from equitable despite high levels of real output. If methods to redistribute income are not used, then the health of the average resident of the country may suffer. This could be due to a lack of government revenue from progressive taxation which may lead to a lack in government spending on health. Therefore, it is important to look at indicators other than GDP and GNI.</p>


The following are examples of health indicators:
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">Life expectancy at birth</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the number of years that a member of the population can be expected to live.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Maternal morality rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes).</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Infant mortality rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">compares the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The maternal and infant morality rates may be low, while the life expectancy may be high due to:</p>


<ul>
<li>Good public healthcare services accessible to all members of the population</li>
<li>A healthy environment with low pollution levels, adequate sanitation systems and safe drinking water</li>
<li>Healthy diets and avoidance of malnutrition</li>
<li>Well educated population</li>
<li>Low levels of inequality and poverty</li>
</ul>



<h5>United States</h5>
<p><b>Life expectancy at birth</b>: 78.6 years (2013)</p>
<p><b>Maternal morality rate</b>: 28</p>
<p><b>Infant mortality rate</b>: 5.9</p>

<h5>Brunei</h5>
<p><b>Life expectancy at birth</b>: 71 years (2013)</p>
<p><b>Maternal morality rate</b>: 27</p>
<p><b>Infant mortality rate</b>: 8.4</p>

<p><small>All of these statistics can be found on the world bank's website and are from 2013.</small></p>

<p>It may seem surprising that such a dominant country like the United States, does not have particularly impressive health statistics compared to a relatively small developing country like Brunei. However, this may be due to inequalities in income and education amongst the population, leading to concentrate areas of poverty. In addition, this could arguably be due to a lack of good medical coverage accessible for all income groups.</p>

<p>In contrast, Brunei's life expectancy may seem relatively high due to policies like the government funded AIDs awareness campaign and the fact that individuals requiring medical assistance unavailable in the country are sent overseas for it at the government's expense.</p>



<h4>Education Indicators</h4>
<p>Like health, education is very important in considering the standards of living within a country. A more educated population also tends to lead to a more productive workforce in the long run, from which economic growth should follow. However, some countries do not follow this pattern because they have strong economic growth but their governments fail to invest in state provided, or subsidized, education which can lead to greater inequality. However, in some cases, developing countries with low GDP levels have focused on sustaining a good education system as their primary focus.</p>



The following are examples of education indicators...
<dl class="row">
	<dt class="col-sm-3">Adult literacy rate</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Primary school enrollment</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">the total enrollment in primary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population of official primary education age.

<p><b>Primary school enrollment</b>: 99.4% (2012)</p>
<p><b>Secondary school enrollment</b>: 111% (2012)</p>

<p><b>Secondary school enrollment</b>: 95% (2012)</p>

<p><small>All of these statistics can be found on the world bank's website and are from.</small></p>

<p>Norway is known worldwide for having very high standards of living, however, Russia, despite being a developing economy, also has very impressive education statistics. This is believed to be due to the communist history of Russia, whose leaders placed great importance on investing in its education system.</p>




<h4>Composite Indicators</h4>
<p>Composite indicators include more than one measure and so are considered to be better indicators of economic development. The main one that tends to be used is the Human Development Index.</p>
<p>The HDI measures development by combining indicators of life expectancy, education attainment, and income. The education component contains two indicators: expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling. The income component is measured by GNI per capita (PPP$).</p>



HDI Value
<dl class="row">

<dt class="col-sm-3">High Human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">0.800 and above</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Medium human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">0.500 - 0.799</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Low human development</dt><dd class="col-sm-9">less than 0.500</dd>
</dl><p>
Some lower income countries may have a high HDI value because of their high life expectancy and education attainment which may be due to their well run and well provided public services.</p>

            <h3 class="anchor" id="item-4-3">4.3: Domestic Factors</h3>
            <h4>Education and health</h4>

<p>Education is extremely important in improving the living standards of a country as it not only benefits the individuals receiving the education, but there is also a wider benefit to society. This is because a more educated, highly skilled workforce tends to have higher levels of productivity and therefore greater national output. This extra income earned from the increase in output can then be reinvested, either privately or by the government through redistributive policies, in order to further improve the country's development. In addition, a more educated population improves communication and can lead to social reform.</p>

<p>The Cuban government spent 12.8% of GDP on education in 2010, whereas the Central African Republic only spent 1.2% in 2010 and 2011. The adult literacy rate for Cuba was 100% in 2012, but 37% for the Central African Republic in 2010. Cuba's HDI value was 0.851 in 2013, in contrast to the Central African Republic's value which was 0.341. It is therefore not surprising that Cuba's population is more productive and it's GDP per capita was $6,051.20 in 2011, whereas the Central African Republic's was $494.90 in the same year.</p>

<p>Like education, the health of the population is an important component in achieving both development and growth. Increased access to public funded medical care is key to increasing the health of the population, as without this the disparity between rich and poor may widen both in terms of income and in terms of their quality of life. A healthier population increases the labour force as more child reach adulthood and have a longer life expectancy. Also each individuals' productivity can improve because they contract fewer illness and therefore need to take less time off from work. </p>

<p>Cuba's health expenditure per capita was $603, whereas the Central African Republic's was just $13 in 2013. Cuba's life expectancy at birth has remained at 79 years from 2010 to 2013, whereas the Central African Republic's has increased from just 49 years to 50. </p>



<h4>Appropriate technologies</h4>



<p>Labour intensive technologies: use more labour in relation to capital. These increase local employment and the use local skills and materials. Incomes and poverty alleviation should also increase.</p>

<p><b>Capital intensive technologies</b>: use more capital in relation to labour. In developing countries with large supplies of labour they displace workers and increase unemployment, reduce incomes and increase poverty. They require skill levels that may be costly and difficult to acquire, as well as relying on expensive imports. However, these are an important component for increase economics growth in more developed countries where there are higher levels of employment anyway. </p>

<p>Technology is important in aiding development, however, it must be suitable for the specific economic, geographical, ecological and climatic conditions. Developing countries tend to require technologies that make use of the abundance of workers, but are relatively easy to maintain and operate. Therefore, often developing countries adopt labour intensive technologies that are slightly more primitive than those adopted by developed countries. For instance, in a developing country it may be preferable to start using ploughs pulled by animals rather than tractors as tractors may lead to an increase in unemployment and have imported into the country which adds to their expense. Also if tractor were used, then workers would also need to be educated in the more complex maintenance. This illustrates why development is usually a gradual process rather than a sudden change. </p>
<p>Technology has also been instrumental in improving the daily lives of individuals in developing countries. Inexpensive tablets and laptops are now being manufactured for children around the world to have greater access to education and reduce the digital divide between the rich and poor. The spread of mobile phones has increased the efficiency of businesses the world over as it has helped to decrease the costs associated with poor communication and given firms in developing countries to opportunity to access international markets more easily. In addition, companies are creating innovative ways to help developing countries make use of their natural resources to use as renewable energy, such as cheap solar panels that now provide electricity to villages where it was previously absent. Other technologies, such as water filters and toilets, are playing an important role in improving the sanitation within developing countries which helps to reduce the spread of diseases. </p>

<p>Here are some specific examples of technology improving the lives of people in developing countries: </p>

<p>After mobile phones were made available to fishermen in Kerala in India, they were able to call several markets and agree on selling prices before landing their fish. Within a few weeks the fluctuation in fish prices subsided, increasing the fishermen's profit by 9% and reducing consumer prices by 4%.</p>

<p>To do business with Shoprite of South Africa when it opened supermarkets in Zambia, local farmers' cooperatives used new marketing and production techniques to improve the quality of their products and services. Shoprite now buys 90% to 95% of its fresh produce from Zambian farmers. In one cooperative, farmers' cash income increased from between $2 and $3 a month to between $50 and $70, and local access to health care and education services improved. </p>




<h4>Micro-credit</h4>
<p><b>Micro-credit</b>: small loans are lent to businesses in developing countries, therefore, enabling them to become independent and self employed.</p>

<p>This can allow families and communities to escape poverty as they have a means of earning their own incomes without taking on large financial risks. This does not only benefit the direct recipients, but other locals as well since individuals can afford to spend more money in their local communities. Therefore, micro-credit can help to encourage self-reliance amongst the communities in which it is available so the benefits should continue for future generations.</p>

<p>Micro-credit is often given to women as they are often responsible for bringing up the next generation and therefore can have a profound influence on the future developed of the country. This therefore grants them the opportunity to raise the standard of living of their families and improve their own physical and social wellbeing.</p>

<p>Micro-credit can also prevent vulnerable individuals from being financially exploited as their is less need to rely on 'loan sharks', who are illegal moneylenders that often charge very high rates of interest. In addition, micro-credit is available to those who are usually unable to take out loans from conventional financial institutions. This is because micro-credit can be offered to individuals without the need for credit ratings or collaterals, which is a security pledged for the repayment of a loan.</p>

<p>However, there are some limitations of micro-credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments may feel less urgency to pursue other poverty reducing policies</li>

<li>A lack of regulation may lead to 'loan sharks' claiming that they are legitimate micro-credit providers</li>

<li>Micro-credit alone is unlikely to be successful at reducing poverty. This is because it may impact the lives of individuals, but the benefits will not be felt equally across the country. Such regional differences may occur because micro-credit providers are more likely to be found in cities as rural areas are more difficult to access.</li>

<li>The government must be reliable in creating an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and investment. Corruption and poor management would likely threaten the success of micro-credit.</li>

</ul>


<h4>The empowerment of women </h4>
<p>Across the world many societies still feature elements of gender inequality. However, women are an essential component of promoting both economic development and economic growth. Gender inequality has a detrimental effect on the quality and quantity of labour and consequentially leads to limited productivity. Allowing women to work and be active members in society directly increases the labour force, therefore, enabling the countries output to increase. In addition, women in developing countries are often responsible for rearing children which means that the education that such children receive is likely to depend on the female members of their community. It therefore seems clear that it is important to educate women in order to improve the quality of the future labour force.</p>
<p>Policies to empower women may focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreasing the female mortality rate</li>

<li>Increasing the access and quality of education for girls and women</li>

<li>Improving the provision of healthcare for women</li>

<li>Improving access to economic opportunities for women. This may include increasing women's participation in the labour force and improving access to micro-credit.</li>

<li>Increasing respect for women both in society and in domestic situations. For example, the government could ensure that women have the vote and are able to express their views.</li>

<li>Limiting gender inequalities from being replicated in future generations. This may be done by using education to reduce misunderstandings about the differences between males and females.</li>

</ul>




<h4>Income distribution</h4>
<p>Income inequality is a significant factor that contributes to poverty and holds back countries from developing. As a result of the unequal distribution of factors of production, inequalities in income begin to occur. For instance, when people settle in an area, individuals acquire land of different quality and quantity. Therefore, when they farm such land, the results and incomes vary. It would seem that in any society some degree of inequality is therefore inevitable and perhaps necessary in order to provide people with incentives to work.</p>

<p>However, small differences in income, can perpetuate to become larger as time goes on. This can occur because the richer in society are more able to afford the opportunities needed to retain the high levels of income. For instance, in corrupt societies bribes may be paid in return for favors, whilst more generally the rich can afford healthcare and education for their children which maintain their high standard of living. In the absence of progressive taxation and transfer payments, the poorer sector of society may fail to benefit from the successes of the higher income earners. This is particularly true if regions become segregated into the rich and poor, as the high incomes remain concentrated in the pockets of great wealth. This demonstrates how the rich may get richer, whilst the poor slip further into poverty.</p>

<p>Large income gaps between the rich and poor have social implications as well, which effect the standards of living. This is because such divisions create misunderstanding and prejudice. In turn, dissatisfaction amongst the poorest may increase and social frictions may be exacerbated.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is important to have an effective progressive taxation system in order to deal with inequalities in the income distribution. This is because in a progressive taxation system, high income earners pay a greater proportion in tax compared to low income earners. The revenue from such a system can then be used to fund transfer payment, including unemployment benefits, and public services, such as education and healthcare. These then allow the lower income earners to have access to more opportunities which can improve their social and economic mobility.</p>
